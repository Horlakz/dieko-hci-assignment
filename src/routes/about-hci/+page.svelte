		<p>
			The history of HCI goes back to the early days of computing when user interfaces were complex
			and challenging to use.
			<br />
			As technology evolved from mainframes to personal computers, the need for more intuitive interfaces
			grew.
			<br />
			HCI research played a key role in developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), making computers
			more accessible.
